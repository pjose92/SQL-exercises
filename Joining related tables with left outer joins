The provided SQL code creates three tables: students, student_grades, and student_projects. The students table contains information 
such as the student's ID, first name, last name, email, phone number, and birthdate. The student_grades table stores the grades of 
each student, including the test name and the corresponding grade. The student_projects table keeps track of the projects assigned to 
students, recording the project's ID, the student's ID, and the project's title. The INSERT statements populate the tables with sample
data, assigning students their respective grades and projects. Overall, these tables and their associated data provide a structured way 
to manage student information, grades, and projects within a database.
