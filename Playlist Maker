This SQL code creates two tables, "artists" and "songs", and then inserts data into these tables.

The "artists" table has columns for "id" (an auto-incrementing primary key), "name" (the name of the artist), 
"country" (the country the artist is from), and "genre" (the genre of music the artist plays).

The "songs" table has columns for "id" (an auto-incrementing primary key), "artist" (the name of the artist who 
recorded the song), and "title" (the title of the song).

The INSERT statements are used to add data to the tables. For example, data on various artists such as "Taylor Swift", 
"ABBA", "Queen" and "Bob Marley" is added to the "artists" table, and data on some of their popular songs like "Shake it off", 
"Mamma mia", "Bohemian Rhapsody" and "My heart will go on" is added to the "songs" table.

The SQL statements following the INSERT statements are used to query the data from the tables.

The first SELECT statement retrieves all the song titles from the "songs" table where the artist is "Queen".

The second SELECT statement retrieves all the artist names from the "artists" table where the genre is "Pop".

The third SELECT statement retrieves all the song titles from the "songs" table where the artist is in the "Pop" genre, 
which is determined by the nested subquery that first retrieves all the artist names from the "artists" table that have the 
genre "Pop" and then matches them with the artist names in the "songs" table.
