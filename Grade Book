The SQL script includes a create table statement that creates a table named student_grades with four 
columns: id, name, number_grade, and fraction_completed. The id column is set as the primary key and is 
automatically incremented with each new record added to the table.

The next six statements are INSERT INTO statements that add data to the student_grades table. The data includes 
six records with the name, number grade, and fraction completed for each student.

The first SELECT statement queries the student_grades table to retrieve the name, number_grade, and percent_completed 
for each student. The percent_completed column is derived by multiplying the fraction_completed column by 100 and then 
rounding the result to the nearest integer using the ROUND function.

The second SELECT statement queries the student_grades table to retrieve the name, number_grade, and letter_grade for each student. 
The letter_grade column is derived using a CASE statement that assigns letter grades based on the student's number grade. Students 
with a number grade of 90 or higher receive an "A", students with a number grade of 80 or higher receive a "B", students with a number 
grade of 70 or higher receive a "C", and all other students receive an "F".

The third SELECT statement queries the student_grades table to retrieve the count of students for each letter grade. The COUNT 
function is used to count the number of records in each group, and the GROUP BY clause groups the records by the letter_grade column. 
The letter_grade column is derived using the same CASE statement as the second SELECT statement.
